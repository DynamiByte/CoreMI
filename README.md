# CoreMI
XXMI but nicer to look at

the first line of code has yet to be written, and my idea of what it'll look like is faint.

I really dont like how XXMI looks and feels, and GIMI seems to never work.

I intend to make a launcher ther looks and feels more like HoYoPlay, with animated BGs that change with every game update and such

For now I only intend to support the games already in XXMI. Maybe I'll add more later on?

Ideally, once the full release is out (1.0.0), It will have every feature that XXMI has, and more.
